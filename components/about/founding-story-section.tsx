                In 2010, a small group of believers gathered with a burning passion to see communities transformed by
                the Gospel. What started as weekly prayer meetings in a humble home soon grew into a movement of faith,
                hope, and love.
              </p>

              <p>
                The founders recognized that true transformation required more than just preachingâ€”it demanded holistic
                ministry that addressed spiritual, social, and economic needs. This conviction led to the establishment
                of Kingdom Missions Center International.

              <p>
                From the beginning, KMCI has been committed to three core pillars: discipleship that builds strong
                foundations of faith, missions that reach the unreached, and development that empowers communities. This
                integrated approach has enabled us to see lasting transformation in the lives of thousands.
              </p>

              <p>
                Today, KMCI stands as a testament to God's faithfulness. What began with a handful of believers has
                grown into a thriving ministry center that serves multiple communities, trains missionaries, and
                provides care for vulnerable children. Our journey continues as we pursue God's vision for even greater
                impact.
